But Usha's happiness turns to fear when she notices strange similarities between Pallavi's wealthy boyfriend Sandeep (Omar Maskati) and a frightening figure from her own past. Although her suspicions are dismissed by friends and family, the more Usha learns about this new man in her daughter's life, the more certain she becomes that an evil force from 30 years earlier has returned with a vengeance.
