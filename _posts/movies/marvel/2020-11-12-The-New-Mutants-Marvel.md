## Storyline

After a near-death experience during a strange tornado, Danielle Moonstar awakens in an abandoned research facility run by the mysterious Dr Cecilia Reyes. There, Dr Reyes introduces Dani to four other equally uncommon teenagers: Illyana Rasputin, Rahne Sinclair, Sam Guthrie, and Roberto da Costa, who wants to keep them safe and sound until they learn how to be in full control of their extraordinary abilities. However, even though the exceptional team of traumatised inmates believes that they're being treated and cared for, before long, they all start to experience horrifying hallucinations. But, this institution was supposed to be a safe place.
