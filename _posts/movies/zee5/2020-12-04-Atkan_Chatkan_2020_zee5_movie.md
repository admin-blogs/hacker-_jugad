## Storyline

It is probably the closest musical that will touchy anyone that is musically inclined, anyone that considers music as an integral part of existence. This story is about one such boy who did not even know how or why he is so much into percussion, since he lives with his dad who is just a depressed alcoholic as far as he can remember and he only has a faint memory of his mom that walked out on them ( or so he was told ) long time back. The story manifests into soul touching incidents to help him realize his musical dream , also reuniting his parents and building great ethical friendships' along this journey with age knowing no limits when it comes to a bond / foundation made purely on the basis of music .
