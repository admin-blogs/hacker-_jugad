## Storyline

Set in Ludhiana, a small town in Punjab, this is the story of an upright and honest man who sacrifices, subverts and manipulates all morality and relationships to save his only son. Judge Bishan Khosla is about to become a High Court Judge when his only son, Abeer Khosla, gets involved in a hit and run. The conscientious Bishan is about to turn his son in, when he learns that the victim is the son of a dreaded and violent gangster, currently in prison because of him. Told with riveting performances by a stellar ensemble (Jimmy Sheirgill, Yashpal Sharma, Meeta Vashisth, Varun Badola) and shot aesthetically in the heart of small-town Punjab, we follow Bishan's fall from grace as he uses his wits and knowledge of the law to save his son, as the bodies pile up.
